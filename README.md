This is a simple Vercel app that creates an image of a computer in space using [Stable Diffusion](replicate.com/stability-ai/stable-diffusion) and returns the image as a png.

It's deployed at https://andreas-github-image.vercel.app/api/api and runs on my profile page https://github.com/andreasjansson
